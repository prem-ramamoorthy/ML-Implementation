# ML-Implementation

Welcome to **ML-From-Scratch**, a comprehensive collection of fundamental machine learning algorithms meticulously implemented from the ground up using pure Python. This repository avoids the use of high-level machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow, focusing instead on building a deep understanding of the core concepts and mathematics behind these algorithms.

### Key Features:
- **Hands-on Learning**: Gain insights into how machine learning algorithms work under the hood.
- **Pure Python Implementation**: Built using foundational libraries like NumPy and Pandas for maximum transparency.
- **Educational Focus**: Ideal for students, educators, and enthusiasts looking to strengthen their grasp of machine learning fundamentals.
